There once was a boy named Alex. He lived a decent life, but he didn't know what to do with his life. Soon he would find something that would change his life.. 
He found a stray dog that become his new best friend. He liked to play fetch with his dog. One day the dog developed super powers and could fetch a ball a mile away in record speed. From the time the ball left Alex's hand to when he got it back, only 10 seconds had passed.
Alex came to the conclusion that he could use his dog's powers to help others. He soon trained his dog to become SuperDog. They worked together to fight crime and catch bad guys.
Alex and his SuperDog worked tirelessly to catch criminals and clean up the streets. After years of hard work, Alex and his SuperDog reached their ultimate goal: world peace. And just like that, Alex and his SuperDog eliminated all fighting off the face of the Earth.
